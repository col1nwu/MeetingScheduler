## Idiosyncrasy

This project must be run on **Ubuntu 22.04 ARM64 systems**.


## Accomplishments

This meeting scheduler can perform both **basic** and **bonus** functionalities. In other words, it is able to find the intersection of time intervals for a list of users requested by the client; it is also able to register a meeting time for them.


## File Descriptions

- `client.cpp`: implementation of Client
- `Makefile`: building and compiling instruction of this project
- `serverM.cpp`: implementation of Main Server
- `serverA.cpp`: implementation of Backend Server A
- `serverB.cpp`: implementation of Backend Server B
- `utils.cpp`: implementation of a list of utility functions
- `utils.h`: header file of utils.cpp
- `README.md`: provides an introduction and overview of this project


## Message Format

- A list of availabilities is formatted as `[[a,b],[c,d]]`.
- Meeting time is formatted as `[a,b]`. It is only used in the bonus part.
- Usernames are separated by comma and space in output, like `a, b, c`, for better readability.
- Usernames are separated by comma in internal communications, like `a,b,c`.
